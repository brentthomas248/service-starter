# Agent instructions

Follow docs/agent-runbook.md exactly.

Rules:
- Work only from a GitHub issue using the Agent Task/Bug template.
- Create a branch per issue: issue-<number>-short-title
- Keep changes minimal; avoid unrelated refactors.
- Always add/adjust tests for behavior changes.
- Run verification commands and paste outputs in the PR.
